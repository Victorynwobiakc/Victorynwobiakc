# Hey there 👋  

I’m **Victory Nwobia**, a Mechanical Engineer with an interest in Software Engineering.

I love building at the intersection of **product design, sustainability, and technology**
— from prototyping eco-friendly machines to designing robotics systems and developing full-stack web platforms. 

⚡ **Passions:**  
- Robotics & AI 🤖  
- Sustainable product design 🌱  
- Full-stack software engineering 💻  
- Turning ideas into real, usable solutions 🚀

🎨 **Outside of work:**  
- Geeking out over futuristic tech concepts and “what-if” engineering ideas 🤯  
- Drawing ✏️
- Long evening walks to clear my head 🌆  J
- Occasionally getting lost in random documentaries 🎥  

✨ **Fun Facts:** 
- I don’t like coffee or tea (yes, I survive on water and vibes)
- I’ve definitely taken apart more things than I’ve successfully put back together 😜
